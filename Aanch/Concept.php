					<h3>The Problem</h3>
					<ul>
					<li>Over 3 billion<sup>[1]</sup> people globally (~400 million<sup>[2]</sup> people in India) use solid fuels to cook or heat their homes on open fires or traditional stoves. Time spent in collecting these solid fuels is roughly 2 hours per woman per day. The highly efficient burning produces a range of health damaging pollutants such as carbon monoxide and fine particles.</li>
					<li>Within poorly ventilated dwellings, the concentration of these pollutants can reach a 100 times the acceptable level. The WHO estimates that over 4.3 million<sup>[1]</sup> people (~0.9 million<sup>[2]</sup> in India) die annually as a result of this Indoor Air Pollution (IAP). These pollutants lead to respiratory, pulmonary, and vision problems.</li>
					<li>The average Indian spends 9%<sup>[2]</sup> of their monthly income on fuel, which is growing at 9% per annum<sup>[2]</sup>, above the current rate of inflation.</li>
					<li>The younger females of households spend long hours on firewood collection and cooking, leaving lesser time for their education.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Our Approach</h3>
					<ul>
					<li>To deal with this scenario, we launched Project Aanch in February 2013. A through demographic study and survey led us to adopt the low smoke cookstove by Phillips and further modified it to solve the local issues.</li>
					<li>We identified 5 women entrepreneurs in Bhati Mines, a rural community in Chatarpur to market, manufacture, and sell the stove.</li>
					<li>These stoves with chimney and soot collector cut down IAP by 48%. As a result of the stoveâ€™s higher efficiency, cooking time is reduced by 50%<sup>[3]</sup> and 42 hours<sup>[3]</sup> (=62-21) are saved per customer per month.</li>
					<li>Profits from sales of the stove makes our women entrepreneurs financially independent.</li>
					<li>The time saved from advanced smokeless stove can now be utilized for education or other profit generating activities.</li>
					</ul>
